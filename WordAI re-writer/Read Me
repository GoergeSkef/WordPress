This plugin needs to be edited manually.
The plugin allows wordpress users to ad WordAI rewrites to their post editing and publishing workflow.
Before uploading to your website, visit wordai-integration.php and replace the example email and api with your own.

After editing the file, zip it and upload to wp plugins.
You should now have a wordAI dropdown in your post editor. 
You can use this to directly send and retrive posts from WordAI.

Cheers
